# Personal Portfolio Starter (Willie Williams)

This repository contains a 4‑page website that meets the assignment requirements:
- **Three to five individual pages** (Home, Projects, Contact, About)
- **Image** placeholders on Home and Projects (`profile.jpg`, `project1.jpg`)
- **Consistent navigation** across pages
- **Table** on Projects page
- **Form** on Contact page (dropdown, radio + legend, comment box, Submit/Reset, distinct colors)
- **Embedded YouTube** on Home
- **mailto** link in footer and on Home/Contact

## Files
- `index.html` — homepage with mailto and embedded YouTube
- `projects.html` — table + image placeholder
- `contact.html` — styled form with required elements
- `about.html` — extra info page
- `styles.css` — shared styles

## Replace Placeholders
- Add your images as `profile.jpg` and `project1.jpg` in this folder.
- Update text content to match your personal brand or topic.
- Swap the YouTube embed URL in `index.html` with your own video if you like.

## Make It Live with GitHub Pages
1. Create a **new GitHub repository** (public) named e.g., `whw2-portfolio`.
2. Upload all files in this folder to your repo (drag‑and‑drop on GitHub or push via Git).
3. In your repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Set **Branch** to **main** (or `master`) and **/root** folder, then **Save**.
6. After a minute, your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/`.
7. Put that link in your submission.

## Zip & Submit
- If needed, zip the folder and upload the zip for grading.
- Ensure all links work across pages and your images load locally or from your repo.
